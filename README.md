## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/macropay-solutions/maravel/wiki) section and in [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/10.x).

## Contributing

We plan to not change the code that often in the [maravel-framework](https://github.com/macropay-solutions/maravel-framework) package and allow you to build packages that use the DI container to extend functionality and also allow retroactive bug fixing.

We remain open for suggestions in the discussions area: https://github.com/macropay-solutions/maravel-framework/discussions

> **Notes:**
> 
> We improved this template vs Lumen 10.0.4 template with:
